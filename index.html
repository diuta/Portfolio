              Alright, so picture this: In front of you, there's a handsome,
              cool, and fun looking indonesian male, but that's just me, Dimas
              Putra Aryawan, but you can call me! Uta. Currently a brainiac that
              studies Computer Science at uni, no biggie. Surprisingly, i'm
              unapologetically nerdy, like
              gets-excited-about-clean-code-and-perfectly-optimized-algorithms
              nerdy. But honestly? Who doesn't love to see it?. <br /><br />

              A full-blown music junkie, probably has more playlists than
              friends (just kidding, (i think)). Constantly blessed with
              everything from girly kpop songs to classic hiphop and raps. And
              also, i'm a serious cinephile. Someone that likes to melt my own
              brain with crazy plot twist with for hours. <br /><br />

              What am i doing currently? funny you should asked that, i'm a very
              busy guy what can i say? (cap). But for real, i'm currently
              focusing on internship, while trying to build fun projects in the
              mean time. But to be honest? if you call me, i'm probably sitting
              on a couch watching some 3 starred rating letterboxd movie or
              listening japanese 80s city pop.

                    First project! I think of it like a mini version of
                    <b>Genius</b>. Even though it was built with simple html, I
                    was pretty proud of this one not gonna lie. Took apple's
                    dynamic island as the navbar lol.

                    which stands for <b>Text-Emotion-Analyzer</b>, is my very
                    first AI project. This is a web app that can analyze the
                    emotion of the inputted text and show their prediction
                    probability on a graph-based plot.

                    Almost the same as <b>Text-Emotion-Analyzer</b>, but it also
                    can recommend the user some songs (that are clickable and
                    will redirect it to the spotify) that are paralleled to the
                    current predicted mood. This was a group project.

                    This is a subscription reminder app. It lets users add
                    subscription, track its due date, show graph-based analytics
                    on user's spendings, and view other app recommendations. It

                    This platform lets users to check their spotify top 5s based
                    on their listening history in the last 1 month. Pretty fun
                    solo project out of curiousity. But since spotify has a
                    strict rule of the usage of spotify APIs, this isn't
                    available for public (yet ðŸ˜œ).
